# epoxy-visibility-tracker-issue
Epoxy provides a way to track [Visibility-Events](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy/wiki/Visibility-Events)  
On our screen we display an EpoxyRecyclerView with PagerSnapHelper and horizontal layout which displays a simple [controller](https://github.com/silentnuke/epoxy-visibility-tracker-issue/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/silentnuke/epoxyvisibilitytracker/FeedController.kt) which contains a list of [Images](https://github.com/silentnuke/epoxy-visibility-tracker-issue/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/silentnuke/epoxyvisibilitytracker/ImageModel.kt) and [LoadingMore](https://github.com/silentnuke/epoxy-visibility-tracker-issue/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/silentnuke/epoxyvisibilitytracker/LoadingMoreModel.kt) view. Also, below the EpoxyRecyclerView we have static panel which depends on the current page and may be in 3 states: `CONTENT`, `LOADING`, `ERROR`.  
[LoadingMore]((https://github.com/silentnuke/epoxy-visibility-tracker-issue/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/silentnuke/epoxyvisibilitytracker/LoadingMoreModel.kt)) view have 3 states: `IDLE`, `LOADING`, `ERROR`.  
If `LoadingMore` is currently visible and state changes from one to another, new LoadingMoreModel is created and then `bind` is called. However `onVisibilityStateChanged` is not tiggered for new model and this leads to incorrect state.
